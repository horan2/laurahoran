            <h2>User Experience Design Case Study</h2>
            <p>For my capstone project at the UW Information School, I partnered with Erika Deal and Danielle Trierweiler to develop a website for the Refugee Forum of King County.</p>
            <p>The website went live in April 2014 and continues to be updated by RFKC, check it out <a href='http://www.kingcountyrefugeeforum.org'>here</a>.</p>



            <h3>Our Partner Organization</h3>
            <p>The Refugee Forum of King County (RFKC) is a non-profit professional organization that supports service providers serving refugees and newly arrived immigrants in the greater Puget Sound area. It is comprised of several participating members, many of which include representatives from government entities (both state and national), local nonprofits and religious service organizations. As such, RFKC demonstrates a wide-variety of information needs.</p>
            <p>One way the RFKC is valuable to its members is through a monthly meeting held in-person each month. An abundance of resources are provided at these meetings (via the meeting agenda, featured-issue guest presentation, and paper hand-outs), however our team immediately noticed there was a complete lack of digital, remote, or asynchronous methods of retrieving the information that was provided. If a member missed a meeting, they were unable to access the meeting’s information. </p>
            <p>Our team's solution to RFKC’s information needs was simple in theory- we would provide the Forum with a website. However, having noted the diverse information needs, we decided to approach our project through a context of extensive user-centered testing, direct feedback, research, and design. In order to create an effective and valuable tool RFKC would use, we had to dive deeper into how they understood and preferred their information. We were at the advantage for this as team of MLIS students; with our skills and experiences rooted in a commitment to public service, information access, equity, and community-support; bore a non-traditional and particularly user-centered approach to website-design.</p>
            <h3>My Role in the Project</h3>
            <p>My role in the project was heavily focused on user experience design. In collaboration with my teammates, I worked to develop personas, sketch wireframes for different pages of the site, and develop an appropriate site map to accomodate various user flows. Additionally, I analyzed user profile feedback to build out a taxonomy of service types to include on the Services page of the website. Once we had a working prototype, I developed a <a href='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/32372329/UsabilityScript.pdf'>usability test script</a> and facilitated usability tests with members of the forum. Based on feedback our team identified specific ways the site could be improved and communicated them to Erika, our development lead. Finally, I stretched my visual design muscles to develop the color scheme, type model, and a logo for the organization. Overall this project has been a great learning experience and my skills have grown tremendously.</p>
